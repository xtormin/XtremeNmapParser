## ⭐ Features
- Parse Nmap XML files.
- Export parsed data to CSV/XLSX/JSON formats.
- Handle a single file or a directory of XML files.
- Configurable output formats and other settings through a YAML configuration file.

## 💥 Key Benefits

- **Filtering Options:** Filter based on specific services or open ports to concentrate on targets of interest while disregarding irrelevant data.
- **Pentest Records:** Keeping track of analyzed data can be beneficial to avoid unnecessary re-scanning, monitor progress over time, and provide an audit trail for review purposes.
- **Network-Wide Vulnerability Detection:** If a vulnerable service is detected on one host, XNP can be used to swiftly search for other hosts in the network potentially running the same service, assisting in identifying vulnerabilities across the network.
- **Easy Data Export:** The ability to effortlessly copy and paste data about vulnerable hosts, filtered by service version, can be a practical feature. It simplifies the documentation of findings, data sharing with colleagues, and inputting data into other tools or reports.
